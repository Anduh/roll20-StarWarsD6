Description: Anakin Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic, a hero of the Clone Wars and the Chosen One of the Jedi Order. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he was known as Darth Vader, Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. Skywalker was born in 41 BBY, forty-one years before the Battle of Yavin, on the planet Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Although he had a mother, Shmi Skywalker, there was no father involved in Skywalker's conception. This revelation led Qui-Gon Jinn—the Jedi Master who discovered Skywalker and liberated him from slavery—to suspect that Skywalker had been conceived by the midi-chlorians. The Jedi High Council initially rejected Jinn's request to train Skywalker, deeming him too emotional and too old to become a Jedi, but later reversed their decision following the Battle of Naboo where they discovered that the Sith had returned.
